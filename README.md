# FS-AI_Compute

## NOTE:
Originally this repository was a 'placeholder' for the release of the 2020 verison of the IMechE FS-AI ADS-DV interface software. Due to the cancellation of the 2020 event this software was not released. Thus the only content in this repository were issues / questions relating to the ADS-DV compute platform and sensors.

Therefore, this repository has been re-purposed to hold information relating to compute and sensing and has been renamed accordingly.

Content will be added over the next few weeks relating to:

* Hardware specifications
* Linux installation & deployment
* CAN communications
* Bench testing

Some existing info can be found here: https://github.com/FS-AI/FS-AI_Compute/issues/1
